            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p><i>100 words</i></p>
            <p>At this stage - the ideal project is a modular project, designed to solve a small problem... </p>
            <p>Ths first problem I can think about would be Marco Polo - this is
                A game that already exists ( pokemon go) but the aim is not to make a game - it is to practice iOS and/ or Android app
                 development  using
                React Native, Xamarin, or come other code once, deploy everywhere native platform
               <p> Utilise Common APIS( namely maps (google), user location( in- phone gps), database such as mongodb, etc)
                 to combine them into this user interface</p>
              <p> Allow for the creation of accounts(!!) or for multiple users to access the system</p> 
              <p> Allow for instantaneous commuication between users located within a radius (Marco!! Polo!!)</p> 
             <p>Simple rewards system for catching someone - its a never-enging game but you can opt out easily ( of course)...</p>   
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p><i>100 words</i></p>
            <p>The motiviaion is to start to create apps in native/ xamarin that utilise some of the common API's that can be used for a mobile app system, and to try and get all of
                of these things to communicate together in a seamless way.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>Description</h2>
m            <p><i>500 words</i></p>
            <p>Here is the overview of the project</p>
            <br />
            <p>Marco Polo/ Geo Marco Polo/ Geo MP is a geolocation massively multi player game which involves the playing of the standard kids game , Marco Polo,
                but on a potentially global scale. As with the traditional game, when you are 'Marco', you are 'it'. Your aim is to seek out other players so that
                you can tag them and so not be 'it'.
            </p>
            <p>How the game will work is by presenting the user with a stylise map of their surroundings. This will be done most likely with an overlay with
                a common mapping technology (Apple Maps for example). This map will have a number of features:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>'Polo' Features'<br />
                    <ul>
                        <li></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>'Marco' features<br></br>
                    <ul>


                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Global features<br></br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Anonymous mode</li>
                    <li>Friend mode</li>
                    <li>Safety Protocols</li>
                    <li><a href="https://vimeo.com/4054339" target="_blank">Mandatory Opt in</a></li>

                </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <br></br>
            <p>In the digital game app sphere, this raises a number of problems - namely :</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anonymity/privacy - how do you keep the game anonymous for those who want it to be so</li>
                <li>Connection/ friendship - how do you allow people who are friends to play with full access required</li>
                <li>Geolocation privacy (gameplay) - How do you show location(during the Marco Polo transaction) but then make sure the
                    location isn't maintained/ saved on the device (camera/ screen recording blocker??)
                </li>
                <li>Categorisation- how do you maintain, and encourage, users in these different spheres of influence</li>
            </ul>
            <br></br>
