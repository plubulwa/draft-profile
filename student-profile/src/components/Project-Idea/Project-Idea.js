            <h1>Project Idea</h1>

            <br />
            <p>#content</p>
            <p>At this stage - the ideal project is a modular project, designed to solve a small problem... Ths first problem I can think about would be Marco Polo - this is
                A game that already exists ( pokemon go) but the aim is not to make a game - it is to practice iOS and/ or Android app development  using
                React Native, Xamarin, or come other code once, deploy everywhere native platfomr
                Utilise Common APIS( namely maps (google), user location( in- phone gps), db such as mongodb, etc) to combine them into this user interface
                Allow for the creation of accounts(!!) or for multiple users to access the system
                Allow for instantaneous commuication between users located within a radius (Marco!! Polo!!)
                Simple rewards system for catching someone - its a never-enging game but you can opt out easily ( of course)...
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>The motiviaion is to start to create apps in native/ xamarin that utilise some of the common API's that can be used for a mobile app system, and to try and get all of
                of these things to communicate together in a seamless way.
            </p>
