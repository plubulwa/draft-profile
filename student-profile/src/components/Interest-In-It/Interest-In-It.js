                <h2>WHEN DID YOUR INTEREST IN I.T. START</h2>
                <p>My early beginnings in IT actually begin with trying to create music on an early 486/
                    Pentium computer, and one of the earliest MIDI capable soundcards. Now this sound card would glitch,
                    have latency issues, and generally cause the computer to crash unless the computer was defragmented
                    regularly, kept up to date, and all sorts of early computing maintenance pitfalls which led me to
                    learn basics about old style computer maintenance, dig into the System BIOS in order to fix common
                    problems, all so that I could make barely passable music in the '90s and early 2000s'.
                </p>
                <p>Following these (extremely) early days, I kept interested on the side- a lot of friends studied IT/
                    design/ other tech/ etc whilst I frankly did other things with my life. But eventually I had the need to create a
                    website; I was looking at creating a site which had interactive code elements ( so it would play like a game if
                    required), but then also have the ability to have some elements with variable/ random text whenever someone
                    accessed the website. The website would also have custom designed graphics and a different, but usable interface.
                </p>
                <p>All of this I realised was not doable with a WIX template; also, difficult, with my lack of knowledge, through
                    a WordPress/ CMS style web architecture. So, I started to learn how to code HTML/ CSS/ JS. As I got deeper into
                    learning how to make the type of website I wanted, I really got into the code. My previous studies meant the
                    logic of code was understandable (I'm a maths head) and thus we get to the study zone and what I am interested in now.
                </p>
                <h2>WHAT IS YOUR INTEREST IN I.T.</h2>
                <p>I would like to use the skills I am learning in a creative aspect – previously I stated that I am musician, and
                    there are a lot of novel technological applications for the use of technology to create or enhance the music experience.
                    I mentioned earlier my need to make a website; this website was the first step in trying to learn the technologies
                    needed for a new way of creating artistic works (music or otherwise) for me. The second step is actually this course – its going to take time!
                </p>
                <p>In general, however, my main interest in IT is programming- making mobile, web and desktop applications. The more I learn about programming the
                    cleaner (!!) my code gets; learning new algorithms and programming styles is a keen interest of mine. Whilst the current environment has a lot of
                    languages, and the need to be proficient in a lot of these seems to be industry standard, having a programming mindset is more important.
                </p>
                <p>Another interest is in User Design/ User Experience. Having previous done some basic design work (mainly in print in the form of band posters),
                    making applications/ websites which look good and are intuitive to use is really important to me.
                </p>
                <p>I have a working knowledge of several languages (JavaScript, Java, SQL) and have started to learn Python, Objective-C/ Swift and React.js/ Node.js.
                    Recently I have looked at implementing a cloud-based NoSQL database (Mongo DB) for a web-based game site that I am in the early days of developing
                    (Sudoku and a Wordle clone are the current projects)
                </p>
                <h2>WHY RMIT</h2>
                <p>RMIT as a university has intersected with me in a number of ways, which has influenced my choice to study here. One response would be :</p>
                <p>“RMIT has a very good reputation in the technology space, and as such I thought it would be a good place to gain a qualification in this space.
                    The other reason is also personal recommendation - Some friends of mine have studied at RMIT previously, and they have stated that they had a
                    very good experience. This was also very important to me as I have friends who have studied course elsewhere (not IT) and have had poor experiences. “</p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Another response is:</p>
                <p>“RMIT has a very vibrant creative community – I have been to multiple art shows and have interacted previously with people who have studied here and
                    how they look at the world once going through the institution is actually an inspiration into the type of thinking that is fostered in the space”
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>All of the above is true, and felt by me, by the way. There is another factor which is incidental but is actually a key driver to how
                    I think about the world, and my choice to study at RMIT. I used to work at a community justice centre in Melbourne, which utilised theoretical
                    knowledge which was, in part, formulated at RMIT (the Centre for Innovative Justice). The methods formulated and used here were actually radical,
                    useful and effective; if there was a space which I could study where the institution encouraged such thought, then I thought this was the space for me.
                </p>
                <h2>WHAT DO I EXPECT TO LEARN</h2>
                <p>In short – I expect to learn the relevant programming skills in order for me to gain employment or start a business in the IT field. I also look
                    forward to learning and properly understanding the architecture and infrastructure of the modern technology space. Whilst I will not be an
                    expert in everything, learning how all the different aspects of technology work today is important for anyone looking to develop applications
                    in the current environment</p>
                <p>I also expect to hopefully generate some good projects during my time at RMIT, with the aim of having a good portfolio of works that
                    highlight the skills learnt and the ability to create the applications, websites, or infrastructures that are required by either my own
                    projects, or other projects for which I would like to join.
