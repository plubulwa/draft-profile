            <h2>Beginnings</h2>
            <br />
            <p> My early beginnings in IT actually begin with my interst in music, which predates everything. A pinaist since I could form sentences,
                muusic has been a constant, and so when it became time for a major, free form school project in which I had to spend considerable hours,
                music was the medium in which I decided to create this project. At them time we had an early 486/ Pentium computer, and one of the earliest MIDI capable soundcards. Now this
                sound card would glitch, have latency issues, and generally cause the computer to crash unless the computer was defragmented regularly, kept up to date,, and all sorts of early computing
                maintenance pitfalls which led me to learn basics about old style computer maintenance, dig into the SystemBIOS in order to fix common problems, all so that I could make
                barely passable music in the '90s and early 2000s'. (This is also the section in which I age myself haha)</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Following these (extremely) early days, I kept interested on the side- a lot of friends studied IT/ design/ other tech/ etc whilst I frankly did other things with my life.
                In brief we can sum this up as :</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Studied some biological sciences, maths and music (all incomplete)</li>
                <li>Joined a couple of bands and had fun touring etc (currently on hiatus?? or a writing phase?? To be continued...)</li>
                <li>Worked in a lot of offices with terrible computer systems</li>
                <li>Learnt some of the basics of graphic and user design from friends who are working/ practitioners, who would gently suggest when my
                    designs were average or worse </li>
            </ul>
            <p>All this is the backdrop- as Shakespeare/ sci-fi writers have said - the past is prologue "</p>
            <h2>Pre- Study</h2>
            <p>All of this began with the need to create a website. I was looking at creating a site which had interactive code elements ( so it would play like a game if required),
                but then also have the ability to have some elements with variable/ random text whenever someone accessed the website. The website would also have custom designed
                graphics and a different, but usable interface.</p>
            <br />
            <p>All of this I realised was not dable with a WIX template, and difficult in my noob knowledge through a WordPress/ CMS style web architecture. So I started
                to learn how to code HTML/ CSS/ JS. As I got deeper into learning how to make the type of website I wanted I really got into the code. My previous studies
                meant the logic of code was understandable ( I'm a maths head) and thus we get to the study zone and what I am intersted in now.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>I also did some online study, and learned a lot ( a lot!) of Java, so now Java i feel relatively confident in, however I have to do some flash python learning.</p>
            <h2>The current focus</h2>
            <p> I am interested in programming mainly- with a desire to build applications and web interface which have good to great functionality, are easy to use, and
                can provide something a little different in how one interacts with and interface, or thinks about how a web page, or and app, should function. I have spent a lot of
                time learning:
                <ul>
                    <li>Java</li>
                    <li>Javascript ('vanilla')</li>
                    <li>React (currently)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I am currently in a steep learning curve with the Swift/ Objective-C iOS framework, and have yet to apply my old school Java knowledge
                    to current Android design patterns. In time I guess.
                </p>
                <p>I would eventually like to be able to use my programming skills across a number of different creative industries as well, including visual and musical applications,
                    however the first step is to get really good at programming patterns so I can tackle anything.
                </p>
                <p>Currently I am working on a small 'portfolio' style puzzle game website made up of modern classics (Sudoku and Wordle). Both are in the process of being coded in the React.JS 
                    framework
                </p>
